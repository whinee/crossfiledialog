A simple configuration for [obsidian-custom-sort plugin](https://github.com/SebastianMC/obsidian-custom-sort). It causes the plugin to take over the control of the order of items in the root folder ('/') of the vault.

Folders and files are treated equally by the plugin (by default) so expect them intermixed in the root vault folder after enabling the custom sort plugin.

To play with more examples go to [its README](https://github.com/SebastianMC/obsidian-custom-sort#readme).
